# Frontend Aesthetics

Avoid generic, "on distribution" outputs that create the "AI slop" aesthetic. Make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

## Focus Areas

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- **Avoid**: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts, Space Grotesk
- **Seek out**: Distinctive choices that elevate aesthetics—explore foundries, variable fonts, and unexpected pairings

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Draw inspiration from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics
- **Avoid**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds, generic blue/gray schemes

### Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library (framer-motion) for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions

### Backgrounds
- Create atmosphere and depth—never default to solid colors
- Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects
- Match background treatment to overall aesthetic

## What to Avoid

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, Space Grotesk)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white, generic corporate blue)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- Converging on the same "safe" choices across projects

## Approach

- Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices
- Design specifically for the context—what fits THIS project?
- Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics
- Think outside the box: if a choice feels obvious, reconsider it
- Each project should feel genuinely designed, not generated
